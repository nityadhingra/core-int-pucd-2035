        <P>I imagine there is a place of deep rest—not in the resting but after,
when the body has forgotten the weight of fatigue or of its many</P>

<P>betrayals—how unfair that once I thought it clever to blame my body
for the wounds in me: the ankle bulbous and aching, the heaviness</P>
<p>in the thigh, and the fat, the encroachment of flesh. It is hard to believe</p>
<p>that there are those who do not know that it is possible to let things</p>
<p>go, to then see the expansion of flesh—it is so easy, and that knowing
is a pathology.</p>
<p class="pull-quote">“What is unknown to me is the clear day of rest—”</p>
<p>I carry a brain of crushed paper, everything unfolds as if by magic,
every spot of understanding is a miracle, I cannot take any credit</p>
<p>for the revelations, they come and go as easily as the wind.</p>
